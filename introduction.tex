We show how the Solidity compiler utilizes an SMT solver to verify
conditions that can be specified as part of the source code.
The main advantage of this system over others for the user is that they do not
need to learn a second verification language. The Solidity language has an
assertion construct that allows to check a condition at run-time.
The verification component tries to verify that these conditions hold for
any input.
