\section{Conclusion}

Outlook: Add storage variables which hold their state across function calls.
This is more complicated, because typically, the smart contract is not designed
to assume all possible states over its potential lifetime. Therefore, the
system should be able to restrict the set of possible states by analyzing
its code.

Apart from these explicit conditions, other conditions like overflows,
divisions by zero or array access out of bounds (planned) are checkd.
