\section{SMT Encoding}

Explain the speciality of Solidity with regards to revert. (perhaps already in the previous section)

Write about how we encode the control flow, what checks we perform (overflow, assert, require, unreachable, trivial condition).

Possible extension: Errors are irrelevant if they will result in a state reversion. So we could change the check to e.g. only flag overflows if they do not result in a state reversion. Popular example, the SafeMath contract:

\begin{verb}
  function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
  \}
\end{verb}
