\section{SMT Encoding}
\label{section:smt}

\section{Implemented (or almost there)}

\todo{Write about how we encode the control flow}\\
\todo{Write about how we encode types (especially integers)}\\
\todo{Write about what checks we perform (overflow, assert, require, unreachable, trivial condition)}

Possible extension: Errors are irrelevant if they will result in a state reversion. So we could change the check to e.g. only flag overflows if they do not result in a state reversion. Popular example, the SafeMath contract:

\begin{verb}
  function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
  \}
\end{verb}

\section{Discussions about the future}

\todo{Loops?}\\
