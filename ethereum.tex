\section{Ethereum}

The Ethereum platform is a system that appears as a singleton networked computer
usable by anyone, but is actually built as a distributed database that utilizes
blockchain technology to achieve consensus. One of the features that
sets Ethereum apart from other blockchain systems is the ability to store and
execute code inside this database. In contrast to traditional server systems,
anyone can inspect this stored code and execute functions. Furthermore,
blockchains typically store ownership relations of valuable goods
(for example cryptocurrencies). Therefore, malicious actors have a monetary
incentive to analyze the inner workings of such code. Because of that,
testing (i.e.\ dynamic analysis of some typical inputs) does not suffice
and analyzing all possible inputs by utilizing static analysis or formal verification
is recommended.
